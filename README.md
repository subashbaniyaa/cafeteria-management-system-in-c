## Note

- The system uses a simple text file ("menu.txt") to store the menu items. Make sure the file is present in the same directory as the executable.

- Admin credentials are hardcoded as follows:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: 123

- The system includes a basic authentication mechanism. Users need to enter the correct username and password to access admin features.
